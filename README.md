# LabyEdit
A map editor for **Labirynth Plus! Edtition**, which was a game originally available for free as a Microsoft Plus Pack for Windows XP. Original level editor has been lost to time apparently.

It allows everyone to edit existing levels from Arcade & Race The Clock modes (extension .lvl) as well as editing MyLabirynth mode levels (.lab). It's possible to erase and place every object in the level. Maps can be saved in \*.lab format, which then can be placed in ../Data/MyLabyrinth/ folder and be visible within the game.

The editor supports two extra themes, unavailable in the base game or its Bonus Pack - Space theme and Demon theme, which require Unofficial Labyrinth Patch to be installed.

Have fun!
